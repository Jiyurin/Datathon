## Project Title
Second Pair of Eyes: Interpretable CTG Classification for Early Fetal Distress Detection

## Project Summary
This project predicts fetal well-being from Cardiotocography (CTG) data—recordings of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions during labor. We build a machine learning model to classify CTG traces into Normal, Suspect, or Pathologic, supporting early detection of fetal distress and assisting clinical decisions. We cleaned and analyzed the UCI CTG dataset, explored key features (baseline heart rate, accelerations, variability, decelerations), and developed an interpretable model that balances accuracy with medical meaning.
